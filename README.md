# AI-based Fraud Management System

This project is an **AI-based Fraud Management System** designed to verify the authenticity of UID Aadhar Cards. It was developed as part of an Infosys Springboard Internship.

## üìú Description

The primary goal of this project is to leverage Artificial Intelligence to validate Aadhar cards, thereby detecting and preventing potential fraud. The system uses a multi-stage pipeline of machine learning models to analyze and verify the submitted card. This includes:

* **Classification Model**: To initially identify if the uploaded image is a valid type of Aadhar card.
* **Detection Model**: To locate and isolate key features and security elements on the card, such as the photograph, QR code, and official emblems.
* **OCR (Optical Character Recognition) Model**: To extract textual information from the card, which can then be cross-verified against a database or official records.

A **Flask** backend serves as the core of the application, integrating these models and exposing them through a web-based interface.

## ‚ú® Features

* **End-to-End Verification**: A complete pipeline to validate Aadhar cards using AI.
* **Modular Architecture**: The system is composed of distinct models for classification, detection, and OCR, allowing for independent updates and improvements.
* **Web Interface**: A simple and user-friendly web interface built with Flask for easy interaction.
* **Fraud Prevention**: Helps in identifying forged or tampered Aadhar cards.
